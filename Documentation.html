		<div> When I was thinking about the data I would use for my interactive visualization, I knew I wanted to use sports data because I am a big sports fan. 
			I then decided I wanted to use the data on my favorite sports team the Cincinnati Reds. I had tons of data and many different options to choose from.
			When I was thinking of designs for my visualization, I first wanted to go with a bar chart and have the players names and when the user would click 
			on the different stat type the bar would change to show all the players numbers from that stat. (Seen on the right)<img src="Draft.png" alt="Draft" width = "1000" height="500" align="Right"><br><br>
			I then realized that there are many different players and that visualization could get very messy very fast. 
			I then heard on the radio the decrease in attendance to major league games in the MLB throughout the years. 
			That made me think to create a visualization for that and try to see if I can find some trends with the visualizations I create. 
			I decided to go with a scatter plot and when the user would click on the games back it would show the games back visualization and when they would 
			click on the wins it would show the wins visualization. <br>
			When creating my visualization and my web page I knew I wanted to incorporate the colors red and blue, because that is the Cincinnati Reds colors 
			and those colors go well together. I used the red to make the words where you click to see the game's back visualization and the wins visualization 
			because I knew that color would attract the attention of the user more. I then made it so the numbers on the scatter plot were invisible unless 
			the user moved their mouse over the point. I did this because the numbers on the scatter plot with the points made the visualization seem very cluttered together. 
			Now the user can hover over the point they want to see and see the exact number. I also made the fan attendance the first visualization that shows. 
			I did this because this is the main focus of the visualization. We want to see the trend of attendance throughout the years. <br>
			I chose to use both wins by year and games back from first by year to answer the question of why the attendance was the way it was. 
			I wondered if the team was winning more games would the attendance to games be higher too. I also thought if the team was being competitive and 
			fighting for a playoff spot would that help the attendance too. I noticed right away that the attendance and wins by year had a pretty similar graph 
			to it. It makes sense that as the wins go up, so does the attendance to games. I also noticed that as the team was closer to first place the higher 
			attendance was for that year.
